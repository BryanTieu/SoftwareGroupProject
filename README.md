# SoftwareGroupProject
This is the start of our group project for software design where we will design and build a software application to predict the rate of fuel based on a few parameters.

07/23/2021 At the moment I have finished the front and back end as well as setting up and connecting the database to the project. Whats left are the fuel price modules and the fuel price history as well as setting up the back end for the calculations. I have uploaded the files in seperate folders that include the table for the database and the files for the front and back end.

08/02/2021 Getting very close I have finally updated the fuelmodule and the fuelhistory files. The fuel pricing functions work and can be cleaned up a bit however the buttons testing still have a few bugs that need to be addressed such as the form data disappearing at times when the button is clicked. Now to address the disable and enabling of the buttons when the form is not filled.

08/04/2021 I am pretty much completed the project and have pushed the files through server, added disablers on the fuel form and fixed the bug on the server page where the user could not access the home because of obs issues. This has been a fun and huge learning experience I will continue to update the project as I go.
