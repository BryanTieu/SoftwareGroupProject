07/23/2021 At the moment I have finished the front and back end as well as setting up and connecting the database to the project. Whats left are the fuel price modules and the fuel price history as well as setting up the back end for the calculations. I have uploaded the files in seperate folders that include the table for the database and the files for the front and back end.
